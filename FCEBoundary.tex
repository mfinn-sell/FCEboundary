\begin{abstract}
The connection between the coarse geometry of metric spaces and analytic properties of topological groupoids is well known. One of the main results of of Skandalis, Tu and Yu is that a space admits a coarse embedding into Hilbert space if and only if a certain associated topological groupoid is a-T-menable. This groupoid characterisation then gives a simple proof that the coarse Baum-Connes conjecture holds for a coarsely embeddable space. The property of a admitting a fibred coarse embedding into Hilbert space was introduced by Chen, Wang and Yu to provide a property that is sufficient for the maximal analogue to the coarse Baum-Connes conjecture and in this paper we connect this property to the traditional coarse Baum-Connes conjecture by constructing a groupoid, similar to the coarse groupoid, that is a-T-menable if and only if the space admits a fibred coarse embedding into Hilbert space. We use this result to give a characterisation of the Haagerup property for residually finite discrete groups.

\section{Introduction}

The application of coarse methods to algebraic topological problems is well known \cite{MR866507,MR1728880}. The primary method utilised for such problems is a \textit{higher index} that allows us to calculate refined large scale information from small scale topological or analytic data. This process can succinctly phrased using the language of K-theory and K-homology and can be encoded completely into the coarse geometric version of the well-known Baum-Connes conjecture, which asks whether or not a certain assembly map:
\begin{equation*}
\mu_{*}:KX_{*}(X)=\lim_{R>0}K_{*}(P_{R}(X)) \longrightarrow K_{*}(C^{*}(X))
\end{equation*}
is an isomorphism for all uniformly discrete spaces $X$ with bounded geometry. One well known approach to this conjecture for a suitable metric spaces $X$ is via the concept of a \textit{coarse embedding into Hilbert space}. A seminal paper by Yu \cite{MR1728880} first showed the importance of a coarse embeddings into Hilbert space by proving that this is a sufficient condition for the coarse Baum-Connes assembly map to be an isomorphism.

In this paper we study the relationship between \textit{fibred coarse embedding into Hilbert space}, first introduced by Chen, Wang and Yu \cite{FCEpaper}, and the coarse analogue of the strong Novikov conjecture. Intuitively, a space admits a fibred coarse embedding into Hilbert space if for each scale it is acceptable to forget bounded portions of the space and embed what remains locally and compatibly into Hilbert space. This is made precise in Definition \ref{def:FCE}. This property was used in \cite{FCEpaper} to prove a maximal analogue of the work of \cite{MR1728880}, that is a fibred coarse embedding into Hilbert space implies that the maximal coarse Baum-Connes assembly map is an isomorphism for any uniformly discrete metric space with bounded geometry.

Another approach to these questions was considered in \cite{mypub1}, in which a conjecture known as the \textit{boundary coarse Baum-Connes conjecture} was defined for uniformly discrete bounded geometry spaces. This conjecture, defined via groupoids, was designed to capture the structure of a space at infinity. We explain the relationship between this conjecture and the work of \cite{FCEpaper} and give a new method to prove the maximal coarse Baum-Connes conjecture in this instance that has additional consequences. We explore these consequences in Section \ref{sect:apps}.

The strategy of this paper is to convert those assembly problems in which we are interested into the world of groupoids as was pioneered by \cite{MR1905840}. We construct a new groupoid $\mathcal{M}(X)$ that can be associated to any sequence of bounded subsets of $X$. This groupoid then plays an important role in characterising fibred coarse embeddability, that is we prove the analogue of Theorem 5.4 from \cite{MR1905840} for a fibred coarse embeddings: 

\begin{theorem}\label{Thm:MR1}
Let $X$ be a uniformly discrete bounded geometry metric space and let $\mathcal{F}:=\lbrace K_{R} \rbrace$ be a nested family of bounded subsets of $X$. Then there exists a groupoid $\mathcal{M}_{\mathcal{F}}(X)$ associated to the family $\mathcal{F}$ such that the following are equivalent:
\begin{enumerate}
\item $X$ admits a fibred coarse embedding into Hilbert space with respect to the family $\mathcal{F}$;
\item$\mathcal{M}_{\mathcal{F}}(X)$ is a-T-menable.
\end{enumerate}
\end{theorem}

As a natural corollary of this result we can conclude information about the boundary groupoid:

\begin{corollary}\label{Thm:MT1}
Let $X$ be a uniformly discrete space with bounded geometry that admits a fibred coarse embedding into Hilbert space. Then the associated boundary groupoid $G(X)|_{\partial\beta X}$ is a-T-menable.
\end{corollary}

This result gives us access to the tools developed in \cite{mypub1} concerning the boundary coarse Baum-Connes conjecture and in in Section \ref{sect:apps} we provide applications of Theorem \ref{Thm:MT1} to the coarse analogue of the strong Novikov conjecture for uniformly discrete spaces with bounded geometry (Theorem \ref{thm:mcor1}), as well as a question of Roe concerning ghost operators within Roe algebras associated to coarsely embeddable spaces (Corollary \ref{thm:IT3}). Lastly we give a characterisation of the Haagerup property for residually finite groups via box spaces (Theorem \ref{thm:cor2}).

We recap now the important details surrounding Theorem 5.4 from \cite{MR1905840} and the notion of a fibred coarse embedding \cite{FCEpaper}.

\section{Fibred coarse embeddings and groupoids associated to coarse spaces}\label{sect:coarse}
Throughout this section $X$ will denote a metric space with a proper metric, unless otherwise stated.

\subsection{Coarse and fibred coarse embeddings}
We first recall the concept of a coarse embedding and motivate the definition of a fibred coarse embedding.

\begin{definition}\label{def:FCE}
A metric space $X$ is said to admit a coarse embedding into Hilbert space $\mathcal{H}$ if there exist maps $f:X \rightarrow \mathcal{H}$,  and non-decreasing $\rho_{1},\rho_{2}:\mathbb{R}_{+} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ such that:
\begin{enumerate}
\item for every $x,y \in X$, $\rho_{1}(d(x,y)) \leq \Vert f(x) - f(y) \Vert \leq \rho_{2}(d(x,y))$;
\item for each $i$, we have $\lim_{r \rightarrow \infty}\rho_{i}(r) = +\infty$.
\end{enumerate}
\end{definition}

The application of a coarse embedding into Hilbert space is the main result of \cite{MR1728880, MR1905840}.

\begin{theorem}
Let $X$ be a uniformly discrete metric space with bounded geometry that admits a coarse embedding into Hilbert space. Then the coarse Baum-Connes conjecture holds for $X$, that is the assembly map $\mu_{*}$ is an isomorphism.\qed
\end{theorem}

Many metric spaces admit coarse embeddings; the property is a suitably flexible one as it is implied by many other coarse properties such as finite asymptotic dimension \cite{MR1739727}, or the weaker properties of finite decomposition complexity \cite{MR2947546} and property A \cite{MR1728880}. The primary application is to finitely generated discrete groups via the well known descent principle in coarse geometry:

\begin{corollary}
Let $\Gamma$ be a finitely generated discrete group admitting a coarse embedding into Hilbert space. Then the (strong) Novikov conjecture holds for $\Gamma$.\qed
\end{corollary}

For more information on the strong Novikov conjecture and its connections to coarse geometry see \cite{MR1388300, MR1905840}.

It is well known that there are spaces that do not admit a coarse embedding into Hilbert space such as expander graphs \cite{MR2569682}. Certain types of expander graph are known to be counterexamples to the Baum-Connes conjecture \cite{higsonpreprint,MR1911663,explg1,explg2,MR2568691}, but it is known that they do satisfy the coarse analogue of the Novikov conjecture and the maximal coarse Baum-Connes conjecture. The notion of a fibred coarse embedding was introduced in \cite{FCEpaper} where the authors gave results that partially explained these phenomena.

The following is Definition 2.1 from \cite{FCEpaper}.

\begin{definition}
A metric space $X$ is said to admit a \textit{fibred coarse embedding} into Hilbert space if there exists
\begin{itemize}
\item a field of Hilbert spaces $\lbrace H_{x} \rbrace_{x \in X}$ over X;
\item a section $s: X \rightarrow \sqcup_{x \in X}H_{x}$ (i.e $s(x) \in H_{x}$);
\item two non-decreasing functions $\rho_{1}, \rho_{2}$ from $[0,\infty)$ to $(-\infty, +\infty)$ such that $\lim_{r\rightarrow \infty}\rho_{i}(r)=\infty$ for $i=1,2$.
\end{itemize}
such that for any $r>0$ there exists a bounded subset $K\subset X$ and a trivalisation:
\begin{equation*}
t_{C}: \lbrace H_{x} \rbrace_{x \in C} \rightarrow C\times H
\end{equation*}
for each $C \subset X \setminus K$ of diameter less than $r$. We ask that this map $t_{C}|_{x}=t_{C}(x)$ is an affine isometry from  $H_{x}$ to $H$, satisfying:
\begin{enumerate}
\item for any $x,y \in C$, $\rho_{1}(d(x,y))\leq \Vert t_{C}(x)(s(x)) - t_{C}(y)(s(y)) \Vert \leq \rho_{2}(d(x,y))$;
\item for any two subsets $C_{1},C_{2} \subset X\setminus K$ of diameter less than $r$ and nonempty intersection $C_{1}\cap C_{2}$ there exists an affine isometry $t_{C_{1},C_{2}}:H \rightarrow H$ such that $t_{C_{1}}(x)t_{C_{2}}(x)^{-1}=t_{C_{1},C_{2}}$ for all $x \in C_{1}\cap C_{2}$
\end{enumerate}
\end{definition}

In particular many expanders are known to satisfy this property, such as those coming from a-T-menable discrete groups or those of large girth \cite{FCEpaper,MR2568691}.

The main application of this property is Theorem 1.1 \cite{FCEpaper}:

\begin{theorem}\label{Thm:FCEMR}
Let $X$ be a proper metric space admitting a fibred coarse embedding into Hilbert space. Then the maximal coarse Baum-Connes conjecture holds for $X$.\qed
\end{theorem}

We give a different proof of this in Section \ref{Sect:apps}.

\subsection{Groupoids and coarse properties}\label{sect:coarsegroupoids}
Groupoids play an integral role in the constructions we adapt from \cite{MR1905840}. Below we recap some basic properties of groupoids before giving an outline of the construction of the coarse groupoid associated to a coarse space $X$.

A groupoid $\G$ is a \textit{topological groupoid} if both $\G$ and $\G^{(0)}$ are topological spaces, and the maps $r,s, ^{-1}$ and the composition are all continuous. A Hausdorff, locally compact topological groupoid $\G$ is \textit{proper} if $(r,s)$ is a proper map and \textit{\'etale} or \textit{r-discrete} if the map $r$ is a local homeomorphism. When $\G$ is \'etale, $s$ and the product are also local homeomorphisms, and $\G^{(0)}$ is an open subset of $\G$.

Let $X$ be a uniformly discrete bounded geometry metric space. We want to define a groupoid with property that it captures the coarse information associated to $X$. To do this effectively we need to define the what we mean by a \textit{coarse structure} that is associated to a metric. The details of this can be found in \cite{MR2007488}.

\begin{definition}
Let $X$ be a set and let $\mathcal{E}$ be a collection of subsets of $X \times X$. If $\mathcal{E}$ has the following properties:
\begin{enumerate}
\item $\mathcal{E}$ is closed under finite unions;
\item $\mathcal{E}$ is closed under taking subsets;
\item $\mathcal{E}$ is closed under the induced product and inverse that comes from the groupoid product on $X \times X$.
\item $\mathcal{E}$ contains the diagonal
\end{enumerate}
Then we say $\mathcal{E}$ is a \textit{coarse structure} on $X$ and we call the elements of $\mathcal{E}$ \textit{entourages}. If in addition $\mathcal{E}$ contains all finite subsets then we say that $\mathcal{E}$ is \textit{weakly connected}.
\end{definition}

\begin{example}\label{ex:MCS}
Let $X$ be a metric space. Then consider the collection $\mathcal{S}$ of the $R$-neighbourhoods of the diagonal in $X\times X$; that is, for every $R>0$ the set:
\begin{equation*}
\Delta_{R}=\lbrace (x,y) \in X \times X | d(x,y)\leq R \rbrace
\end{equation*}
Then let $\mathcal{E}$ be the coarse structure generated by $\mathcal{S}$. This is called the \textit{metric coarse structure} on $X$. If  $X$ is a uniformly discrete bounded geometry  metric space this coarse structure is uniformly locally finite, proper and weakly connected.
\end{example}

Let $X$ be a uniformly discrete metric space with bounded geometry. 

Define $G(X):=\bigcup_{R>0}\overline{\Delta_{R}} \subseteq \beta(X\times X)$. Then $G(X)$ is a locally compact, Hausdorff topological space. To equip it with a product and inverse we would ideally have liked to be considering the natural extension of the pair groupoid product on $\beta X \times \beta X$.  We remark that the map $(r,s)$ from $X \times X$ extends first to an inclusion into $\beta X \times \beta X$ and universally to $\beta( X \times X)$, giving a map $(r,s): \beta (X\times X) \rightarrow \beta X \times \beta X$. We can restrict this map to each entourage $E \in \mathcal{E}$ allowing us to map the set $G(X)$ to $\beta X \times \beta X$. 

\begin{lemma}\label{Lem:CorRoe}\cite[Corollary 10.18]{MR2007488}
Let $X$ be a uniformly discrete bounded geometry metric space, let $E$ be any entourage and let $\overline{E}$ its closure in $\beta(X \times X)$. Then the inclusion $E \rightarrow X \times X$ extends to a topological embedding $\overline{E} \rightarrow \beta X \times \beta X$.
\end{lemma}

Using this Lemma, we can conclude that the groupoid $G(X)$ can be embedded topologically into $\beta X \times \beta X$ and so we can equip it with the induced product and inverse.

The following Theorem makes precise the ways in which $G(X)$ captures the coarse geometry of $X$.

\begin{theorem}\label{thm:coarseprop}
Let $X$ be a uniformly discrete space with bounded geometry and let $G(X)$ be its coarse groupoid. Then the following hold:
\begin{enumerate}
\item $X$ has property A if and only if $G(X)$ is amenable \cite[Theorem 5.3]{MR1905840};
\item $X$ admits a coarse embedding into Hilbert space if and only if $G(X)$ is a-T-menable \cite[Theorem 5.4]{MR1905840}.\qed
\end{enumerate}
\end{theorem}

The latter aspect of Theorem \ref{thm:coarseprop} is characterised by the groupoid $G(X)$ admitting a proper negative type function to $\mathbb{R}$, which Tu proved was equivalent to a proper affine action on Hilbert space \cite{MR1703305}. 

\section{Negative type functions on groupoids}\label{sect:negtype}
The role of positive and conditionally negative type kernels within group theory is well known and plays an important role in studying both anayltic and representation theoretic properties of groups \cite{MR2415834,MR1487204}. These ideas were extended to groupoids by Tu \cite{MR1703305}. Let $\G$ be a locally compact, Hausdorff groupoid.

\begin{definition}
A continuous function $F: \G \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ is said to be of \textit{negative type} if 
\begin{enumerate}
\item $F|_{\G^{(0)}}=0$;
\item $\forall x \in \G, F(x)=F(x^{-1})$;
\item Given $x_{1},...,x_{n} \in \G$ all having the same range and $\sigma_{1},...,\sigma_{n} \in \mathbb{R}$ such that $\sum_{i}\sigma_{i}=0$ we have $\sum_{j,k}\sigma_{j}\sigma_{k}F(x_{j}^{-1}x_{k})\leq 0$.
\end{enumerate}
\end{definition}

The important feature of functions of this type is their connection to the Haagerup property for locally compact, $\sigma$-compact groupoids, in fact the following are equivalent by work of Tu \cite{MR1703305}:
\begin{enumerate}
\item There exists a proper negative type function on $\G$
\item There exists a continuous field of Hilbert spaces over $\G^{(0)}$ with a proper affine action of $\G$.
\end{enumerate}
An alternative proof of this is given by Renault in Section 2.4 of \cite{Renault2012}.

\section{Main Theorem}
We dedicate this section to proving Theorem \ref{Thm:MR1}.

\subsection{The groupoid $\mathcal{M}_{\mathcal{F}}(X)$}

In this section we outline the construction of the groupoid $\mathcal{M}_{\mathcal{F}}(X)$ associated with a family of bounded subsets $\mathcal{F}$ of $X$. We then outline the construction of a negative type function on this groupoid provided a fibred coarse embedding into Hilbert space. This will prove one direction of Theorem \ref{Thm:MR1}.

\begin{definition}
Let $\mathcal{F}:=\lbrace K_{R} \rbrace$ be a family of bounded subsets of X. Let $A_{R}$ be restricted entourage $\Delta_{R}\cap ((X\setminus K_{R}) \times (X\setminus K_{R}))$. Then we denote by $\mathcal{M}_{\mathcal{F}}(X)$ the set $\bigcup_{R>0} \overline{A}_{R}$, where $\overline{A}_{R}$ is the closure in $\beta (X\times X)$.
\end{definition}

\begin{lemma}
$\mathcal{M}_{\mathcal{F}}(X)$ is a groupoid with operations induced from the pair groupoid operation defined where it makes sense; i.e for $(x,y) \in A_{R}, (y^{'},z)\in A_{S}$:
\begin{equation*}
(x,y)(y^{'},z)=(x,z) \mbox{ if } y=y^{'} \mbox{ and } (x,z) \in A_{R+S}.
\end{equation*}
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
The groupoid axioms are technical, but clear. Lemma \ref{Lem:CorRoe} still applies to ensure this product passes to the boundary, where it defines the same product present on the boundary groupoid $G(X)|_{\partial\beta X}$.
\end{proof}

\begin{rem}\label{rem:outline}
Let $X$ admit a fibred coarse embedding into Hilbert space.
\begin{enumerate}
\item $A_{R}:=\Delta_{R}(X\setminus K_{R})$ is an entourage with the same corona as $\Delta_{R}$. Assume that $X$ admits a fibred coarse embedding into Hilbert space with respect to $\mathcal{F}$. Then for each $R>0$ such that and the following function is defined on $A_{R}$:
\begin{equation*}
k_{R}(x,y)=\Vert t_{x}(x)(s(x))-t_{x}(y)(s(y))\Vert^{2}
\end{equation*}
where $t_{x}:H_{x} \rightarrow \mathcal{H}$ is the affine isometry provided by the fibred coarse embedding.
\item In the special case that $X$ is a space of graphs $\sqcup X_{i}$, the $A_{R}$'s defined above have the form: $A_{R}= \sqcup_{i\geq i_{R}}\Delta_{R}^{i}$ for some $i\geq i_{R}$.
\item It is clear that $G(X)|_{\partial\beta X}$ is the boundary groupoid of $\mathcal{M}_{\mathcal{F}}(X)$.
\item For each $\gamma \in \mathcal{M}_{\mathcal{F}}(X)$ there is a smallest $R$ such that $\gamma \in \overline{A_{R}}$. Specifically for $G(X)|_{\partial\beta X} = \bigcup_{R>0} \overline{\Delta_{R}}\setminus \Delta_{R}$ there is a smallest $R>0$ such that $\gamma \in \overline{\Delta_{R}}\setminus \Delta_{R}$. We denote this by $R_{\gamma}$.
\end{enumerate}
\end{rem}

We now extend each $k_{R}$ using the universal property of $\beta A_{R} \cong \overline{A_{R}} \subset \mathcal{M}_{\mathcal{F}}(X)$. Define $f$ pointwise using the formula $f(\gamma):= \tilde{k}_{R_{\gamma}}(\gamma)$.

\begin{proposition}\label{prop:wd}
The function $f$ is well defined and continuous on $\mathcal{M}_{\mathcal{F}}(X)$.
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}
We have two considerations:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Extending $k_{R}$ to $\tilde{k}_{R}$ on the closure of $A_{R}$ for each $R>0$.
\item Each $\tilde{k}_{R}$ pieces together; for any $S>R$ we have that $\tilde{k}_{S}(\gamma)=\tilde{k}_{R}(\gamma)$.
\end{enumerate}
We first prove (1). Under the assumption that $X$ fibred coarsely embeds into Hilbert space, we know that each $k_{R}$ is a bounded function on $A_{R}$, hence extends to a continuous function $\tilde{k}_{R}$ on the Stone-Cech compactification of $A_{R}$, which in this context is homeomorphic to its closure in $\beta(X \times X)$. 

For the proof of (2) consider the sets $A_{R}$ and $A_{R}^{S}:=A_{R}\cap A_{S}$. Using the compatibility properties of a fibred coarse embedding we can see that the function $k_{R}$, and $k_{S}$ restricted to $A_{R}^{S}$ agree; consider that for any $(x,y)\in A_{R}^{S}$ there is a unique affine isometry $t_{B}$ such that $t_{B}t_{B_{S}}(x) = t_{B_{R}}(x)$. As $k_{R}$ is preserved by affine isometries for all $R>0$ and as $A_{R}^{S}$ and $A_{R}$ have the same corona, we have that $\tilde{k}_{R}$ and $\tilde{k}_{S}$ restricted to $\overline{A_{R}}\setminus A_{R}$ agree. Hence we can define, for any $\gamma \in \mathcal{M}_{\mathcal{F}}(X)$, $f(\gamma) = \tilde{k}_{R_{\gamma}}(\gamma)$, which is the natural continuous function defined on the union $\cup_{R>0}\overline{A_{R}}$.
\end{proof}


\begin{lemma}\label{lem:MT1-a}
The function $f$ is proper.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
To see $f$ is proper it is enough to prove that the preimage of an interval $[0,r]$ is contained in $\overline{A_{R}}$ for some $R>0$. This is as each interval $[0,r]$ is a closed subset of $\mathbb{R}$, the map $f$ is continuous and hence $f^{-1}([0,r])$ would be a closed subset of a compact set, hence would itself be compact.

We now assume for a contradiction that the preimage of $[0,r]$ contains elements $\gamma$ with the $R$ given by Remark \ref{rem:outline}.(1) being arbitrarily large. In this proof we denote that $R$ by $R_{\gamma}$. Then from the definition of $f$ and the fact that $X$ admits a fibred coarse embedding, we can see:
\begin{equation*}
\rho_{-}(R_{\lambda})^{2} \leq f(\gamma_{\lambda}) \leq \rho_{+}(R_{\lambda})^{2}.
\end{equation*}
As $\rho_{-}(S)$ tends to infinity if $S$ does, we can find an $S>0$ such that $\rho_{-}(S)>r$. By assumption there exists $\gamma \in f^{-1}([0,r])$ with $R_{\gamma}$ as large as we like, in particular $R_{\gamma}>S$, which is impossible. Whence, there exists an $R>0$ such that $f^{-1}([0,r]) \subset \overline{A_{R}}$.
\end{proof}


\begin{lemma}\label{lem:MT1-b}
The function $f$ is of negative type.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
This relies on the ideas of \cite[Theorem 5.4]{MR1905840}, and it is enough to check that this holds for the boundary subgroupoid $G(X)|_{\partial\beta X}$ of $\mathcal{M}_{\mathcal{F}}(X)$, as it clearly holds for its compliment. Let $\gamma_{1},...,\gamma_{n} \in G(X)|_{\partial\beta X}$ such that $r(\gamma_{1})=...=r(\gamma_{n}):=\omega$ and let $\sigma_{1},...,\sigma_{n} \in \mathbb{R}$ with sum $0$. We need to prove that:
\begin{equation*}
\sum_{i,j}\sigma_{i}\sigma_{j}f(\gamma_{i}^{-1}\gamma_{j}) \leq 0.
\end{equation*}
As there are only finitely many $\gamma_{i}$, there exists a smallest $R>0$ such that each $\gamma_{i}$ and each product $\gamma^{-1}_{j}\gamma_{i}$ are elements of $\overline{\Delta_{R}}$. Let $(x_{i,\lambda},y_{i,\lambda})$ be nets within $\Delta_{R}$ that converge to $\gamma_{i}$ respectively. As the ranges of the $\gamma_{i}$ are all equal, we know that $y_{\lambda_{i}}\rightarrow \omega$ for each $i$, so we can assume without loss of generality that $y_{\lambda,i}=y_{\lambda}$ is equal in each net. Hence, for each $\lambda$, we know that $(x_{\lambda,i},y_{\lambda})$ and $(x_{\lambda,j},x_{\lambda,i}) \in \Delta_{S}$, and that $x_{\lambda,i}, x_{\lambda,j}\in B_{S}(y_{\lambda})$.

Now we compute, relative to $y_{\lambda}$.
\begin{eqnarray*}
&&\sum_{i,j}\sigma_{i}\sigma_{j}k_{S}^{y_{\lambda}}(x_{\lambda, j},x_{\lambda, i}) = \sum_{i,j}\sigma_{i}\sigma_{j}\Vert t_{y_{\lambda}}(x_{\lambda ,j})(s(x_{\lambda ,j})) - t_{y_{\lambda}}(x_{\lambda ,i})(s(x_{\lambda ,i})) \Vert^{2}\\
&&= \sum_{i,j}\sigma_{i}\sigma_{j}(\Vert t_{y_{\lambda}}(x_{\lambda ,j})(s(x_{\lambda ,j})) \Vert^{2} + \Vert t_{y_{\lambda}}(x_{\lambda ,i})(s(x_{\lambda ,i})) \Vert^{2} - 2 \langle t_{y_{\lambda}}(x_{\lambda ,j})(s(x_{\lambda ,j})), t_{y_{\lambda}}(x_{\lambda ,i})(s(x_{\lambda ,i}))\rangle)\\
&&=(\sum_{j}\sigma_{j}\Vert t_{y_{\lambda}}(x_{\lambda ,j})(s(x_{\lambda ,j})) \Vert^{2})(\sum_{i}\sigma_{i})+(\sum_{i}\sigma_{i}\Vert t_{y_{\lambda}}(x_{\lambda ,i})(s(x_{\lambda ,i})) \Vert^{2})(\sum_{j}\sigma_{j})\\
&&  -2\langle \sum_{j}\sigma_{j}t_{y_{\lambda}}(x_{\lambda ,j})(s(x_{\lambda ,j})),\sum_{i}\sigma_{i}t_{y_{\lambda}}(x_{\lambda ,i})(s(x_{\lambda ,i}))\rangle \leq 0.
\end{eqnarray*}
This holds for each $\lambda$ in the net. Taking a limit in $\lambda$:
\begin{equation*}
\sum_{i,j}\sigma_{i}\sigma_{j}f(\gamma_{i}^{-1}\gamma_{j})=\sum_{i,j}\sigma_{j}\sigma_{i}\lim_{\lambda}k_{S}^{y_{\lambda}}(x_{\lambda ,j},x_{\lambda, i}) \leq 0
\end{equation*}
\end{proof}

The preceding Lemmas prove the following Theorem, which is one half of Theorem \ref{Thm:MR1}.

\begin{theorem}\label{Thm:MT2}
Let $X$ be a uniformly discrete space with bounded geometry that admits a fibred coarse embedding into Hilbert space with respect to the family $\mathcal{F}:=\lbrace K_{R} \rbrace_{R>0}$. Then there is a proper conditionally negative type function defined on $\mathcal{M}_{\mathcal{F}}(X)$.\qed
\end{theorem}

We immediately get the following corollary, which is important for the applications of Section \ref{sect:apps}.

\begin{corollary}\label{thm:MT1-a}
Let $X$ as above. Then the boundary groupoid $G(X)|_{\partial\beta X}$ is a-T-menable. \qed
\end{corollary}

\subsection{The other half of Theorem \ref{Thm:MR1}}

In this section we prove the converse to Theorem \ref{Thm:MT2}. Fix $\mathcal{F}:=\lbrace K_{R} \rbrace$ as a family of finite subsets of $X$.

\begin{proposition}
If $\mathcal{M}_{\mathcal{F}}(X)$ is a-T-menable, then $X$ admits a fibred coarse embedding into Hilbert space with respect to $\mathcal{F}$.
\end{proposition} 
\begin{proof}
Under the assumption of a-T-menability, as outlined in Section \ref{sect:negtype}, it is known that the groupoid $\mathcal{M}_{\mathcal{F}}(X)$ admits a continuous, proper, isometric affine action on a Hilbert bundle over $\mathcal{M}_{\mathcal{F}}(X)^{(0)}$ \cite{MR1703305,Renault2012}. Without loss, we can also assume that $X \subset \mathcal{M}_{\mathcal{F}}(X)^{(0)}$. To construct a fibred coarse embedding we first construct the section:
\begin{equation*}
s(x) = 0_{x} \in H_{x}
\end{equation*}
Now we construct the trivialisation for each $R>0$. Consider $C$, a subset of $X\setminus K_{R}$ of diameter at most $R$ by picking a basepoint $x_{C} \in C$ then using the isometric affine action of $\mathcal{M}_{\mathcal{F}}(X)$:
\begin{equation*}
t_{C}(x)=\alpha(x_{C},x)
\end{equation*}
Now it follows that $\Vert t_{C}(x)(s(x)) - t_{C}(y)(s(y)) \Vert = \Vert \alpha(y,x)0_{x} \Vert$ as the groupoid acts by affine isometries. Given that $\gamma \rightarrow \Vert \alpha(\gamma)0_{r(\gamma)} \Vert$ is a continuous proper map and the closures of the $A_{R}$ are compact we can deduce that property (1) from Definition \ref{def:FCE} holds for any $C$. 

From here, we are left to check property (2) of Definition \ref{def:FCE}. Let $C_{1}$ and $C_{2}$ be sets of diameter at most $R>0$ and nonempty intersection, then choose base points $x_{0}, x_{1}$ for $C_{1}$ and $C_{2}$ respectively. We can assume without loss of generality that $x_{i}$ belong to the intersection, whence the transform $\alpha(x_{1},x_{0})$ arising from the affine action of $\mathcal{M}_{\mathcal{F}}(X)$ proves the existence of an affine isometry that changes $t_{C_{1}}$ into $t_{C_{2}}$ everywhere on the intersection. 
\end{proof}

We have now completed the proof of the following analogue of Theorem 5.4 of \cite{MR1905840}:

\begin{theorem}
Let $X$ be a uniformly discrete metric space of bounded geometry and let $\mathcal{F}:=\lbrace K_{R} \rbrace$ be a family of bounded subsets of $X$. Then the following are equivalent:
\begin{enumerate}
\item $X$ admits a fibred coarse embedding into Hilbert space with respect to $\mathcal{F}$;
\item The groupoid $\mathcal{M}_{\mathcal{F}}(X)$ is a-T-menable. \qed
\end{enumerate}
\end{theorem}

\section{Applications}\label{sect:apps}

\subsection{The boundary coarse Baum-Connes conjecture and the coarse Novikov conjecture}\label{Sect:apps}
Throughout this section let $A_{\partial}$ denote the quotient $C^{*}$-algebra $l^{\infty}(X,\mathcal{K})/C_{0}(X,\mathcal{K})$. Recall from \cite{mypub1} the boundary coarse Baum-Connes conjecture.
\begin{conjecture1} [Boundary Coarse Baum-Connes Conjecture]
Let $X$ be a uniformly discrete bounded geometry metric space. Then the assembly map:
\begin{equation*}
\mu_{bdry}:K_{*}^{top}(G(X)|_{\partial\beta X}, A_{\partial}) \rightarrow K_{*}(A_{\partial}\rtimes_{r}G(X)|_{\partial\beta X})
\end{equation*}
is an isomorphism.
\end{conjecture1}

This conjecture also has a maximal form \cite[Section 4]{mypub1}, which is equivalent to the maximal coarse Baum-Connes conjecture at infinity from \cite{FCEpaper}. If $X$ is a uniformly discrete bounded geometry metric space we can see that the algebra at infinity defined in \cite{FCEpaper} and the groupoid crossed product algebra $A_{\partial}\rtimes_{m}G(X)|_{\partial\beta X}$ are isomorphic. Proceeding via this conjecture we can appeal the machinery of Tu \cite{MR1703305} concerning $\sigma$-compact, locally compact a-T-menable groupoids to conclude results about the (maximal) coarse Baum-Connes conjecture. 

In particular, we can use this conjecture and homological algebra to conclude Theorem \ref{Thm:FCEMR}.

\begin{theorem}\cite[Theorem 1.1]{FCEpaper}
Let $X$ be a uniformly discrete space with bounded geometry that fibred coarse embeds into Hilbert space. Then the maximal coarse Baum-Connes assembly map is an isomorphism for $X$.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
We have a short exact sequence of groupoid $C^{*}$-algebras:
\begin{equation*}
0 \rightarrow \mathcal{K} \rightarrow C^{*}_{max}(G(X)) \rightarrow C^{*}_{max}(G(X)|_{\partial\beta X}) \rightarrow 0.
\end{equation*}
This gives us the following diagram, arising from the long exact sequence in K-theory and suitable Baum-Connes conjectures (omitting the coefficients):
\begin{equation*}
\xymatrix@=0.7em{
K_{1}(C^{*}(G(X)|_{\partial\beta X}) \ar[r] & K_{0}(\mathcal{K}) \ar[r]& K_{0}(C^{*}(G(X))) \ar[r]& K_{0}(C^{*}(G(X)|_{\partial\beta X})\ar[r] & K_{1}(\mathcal{K})  \\
K_{1}^{top}(G(X)|_{\partial\beta X}) \ar[r] \ar[u]& K_{0}^{top}(X \times X) \ar[r]\ar[u]^{\ucong}& K_{0}^{top}(G(X)) \ar[r]\ar[u]& K_{0}^{top}(G(X)|_{\partial\beta X}) \ar[r]\ar[u]^{\mu_{bdry}}& K_{1}^{top}(X \times X)\ar[u]^{\ucong}
}
\end{equation*}
By Corollary \ref{Thm:MT1} the maximal boundary assembly map is an isomorphism. The result now follows from the Five lemma.
\end{proof}

To understand the reduced assembly map requires a more delicate approach.

\begin{definition}
Let $X$ as above. We say that $X$ has an \textit{infinite coarse component} if there exists $E \in \mathcal{E}$ such that $P_{E}(X)$ has an infinite connected component. Otherwise we say that $X$ \textit{only has finite coarse components}. In the metric coarse structure, this condition becomes: if there exists an $R>0$ such that $P_{R}(X)$ has an infinite connected component.
\end{definition}

\begin{lemma}\label{lem:zandi}
Let $X$ be a uniformly discrete bounded geometry metric space, $i: \mathcal{K} \hookrightarrow C^{*}X$ be the inclusion of the compact operators into the Roe algebra of $X$ and $j:X\times X \rightarrow G(X)$. Then:
\begin{enumerate}
\item If $X$ has an infinite coarse component then the map from $K^{top}(X \times X; C_{0}(X,\mathcal{K})) \rightarrow K^{top}(G(X); \ell^{\infty}(X,\mathcal{K}))$ is the $0$ map.
\item If $X$ has only finite coarse components then $i_{*}:K_{*}(\mathcal{K}) \rightarrow K_{*}(C^{*}X)$ is injective.
\end{enumerate}
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
Without loss of generality we state the proof for graphs. 

Claim (1) relies on an argument involving groupoid equivariant KK-theory \cite{MR1656031,MR1686846,MR1798599}. We remark that it is useful in this instance to decompose $G(X)=\beta X \rtimes \G_{A}$, where $\G_{A}$ is some second countable, Hausdorff \'etale groupoid that contains the pair groupoid $X \times X$ as an open subgroupoid. This is possible by Lemma 3.3b) of \cite{MR1905840}. We then identify $KK_{\G_{A}}$ with $KK_{G(X)}$ where appropriate using Theorem 3.8 from \cite{cbcag2}. Let $Z$ be a proper $\G_{A}$-space (such as $P_{E}(\G_{A})$ for some entourage $E$), $U$ be the preimage of $X$ under the anchoring map and $Z_{x}$ be the preimage of the singleton $x \in X$ We consider the following diagram, with notation following \cite{MR1905840,MR1656031}:
\begin{equation*}
\xymatrix{KK_{X\times X}(C_{0}(U),C_{0}(X,\mathcal{K})) \ar[r]_{1} & KK_{\G_{A}}(C_{0}(Z),\ell^{\infty}(X,\mathcal{K})) \ar[r]^{\cong}_{4}  & KK(C_{0}(Z_{x}),\mathbb{C}) \\
& KK(\mathbb{C},\mathbb{C}) \ar^{\cong}_{2}[lu]\ar[u]_{3}\ar[ur]_{5}&
}
\end{equation*}
If this diagram commutes for any proper $\G_{A}$-space $Z$ then we can consider $Z = P_{E}(\G_{A})$ and take the limit through the directed set of entourages $E \in \mathcal{E}$:
\begin{equation*}
\xymatrix{K^{top}(X \times X, C_{0}(X,\mathcal{K})) \ar[r] & K^{top}(\G_{A},\ell^{\infty}(X,\mathcal{K})) \ar[r]^{\cong}  & KX_{*}(X) \\
& KK(\mathbb{C},\mathbb{C}) \ar^{\cong}[lu]\ar[u]\ar[ur]&
}
\end{equation*}
Where Theorem 3.8 \cite{cbcag2} allows us to identify $K^{top}_{*}(X\times X , C_{0}(X,\mathcal{K}))$ with $K^{top}_{*}(\G_{A}, C_{0}(X,\mathcal{K}))$ and $K^{top}(G(X), \ell^{\infty}(X,\mathcal{K}))$ with $K^{top}_{*}(\G_{A},\ell^{\infty}(X,\mathcal{K}))$. We can then conclude the result by observing that having an infinite coarse component in $X$ implies that including a point factors through the coarse K-homology of a ray and hence is the zero map.

We now prove the first diagram commutes. Consider the maps:
\begin{eqnarray*}
1 & : & (E,\phi , F) \mapsto (E\otimes_{\psi}\ell^{\infty}(X,\mathcal{K}),\phi \otimes 1 , F \otimes 1)\\
2 & : & (\mathbb{C},1,0) \mapsto (C_{0}(X,\mathcal{K}),\tilde{\rho_{1}},0)\\
3 & : & (\mathbb{C},1,0) \mapsto (\ell^{\infty}(X,\mathcal{K}),\tilde{\rho_{2}},0)\\
4 & : & (E,\phi , F) \mapsto (E|_{x},\phi|_{x},F|_{x})\\
5 & : & (\mathbb{C},1,0) \mapsto (\mathbb{C},\delta_{x},0)
\end{eqnarray*}

Where $\psi$ is the inclusion of $C_{0}(U)$ into $C_{0}(Z)$ and $\tilde{\rho_{1}}$ denotes the extension of the homomorphism $\rho_{1}: C_{0}(X) \rightarrow C_{0}(X,\mathcal{K})$ to $C_{0}(U)$ as multipliers provided by Proposition 2.3 of \cite{MR1325694}. Similarly, $\tilde{\rho_{2}}$ denotes the extension of $\rho_{2}: \ell^{\infty}(X) \rightarrow \ell^{\infty}(X,\mathcal{K})$ to $C_{0}(Z)$ as multipliers.

From here it is easy to see the first triangle commutes by observing that $\rho_{2}$ restricted to $C_{0}(X)$ is $\rho_{1}$ and the second triangle commutes by just considering the evaluation at $x$.

Claim (2) in the context of graphs reduces to studying sequences of finite graphs equipped with a coarsely disjoint box metric. In this context, this is Proposition 2.9 of \cite{mypub1}.
\end{proof}

\begin{theorem}\label{thm:mcor1}
Let $X$ be a uniformly discrete bounded geometry metric space that admits a fibred coarse embedding into Hilbert space. Then the coarse Baum-Connes assembly map for $X$ is injective.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
For a uniformly discrete space $X$ with bounded geometry we know that the ghost ideal $I_{G}$ fits into the sequence:
\begin{equation*}
0 \rightarrow I_{G} \rightarrow C^{*}X \rightarrow A_{\partial}\rtimes G(X)|_{\partial\beta X} \rightarrow 0.
\end{equation*}
This gives rise to the ladder in K-theory and K-homology where the rungs are the assembly maps defined in \cite{mypub1} (omitting coefficients):
$$
\xymatrix@=1em{
\ar[r] & K_{1}(C^{*}_{r}(G(X)|_{\partial\beta X}) \ar[r] & K_{0}(I_{G}) \ar[r]& K_{0}(C^{*}_{r}(G(X))) \ar[r]& K_{0}(C^{*}_{r}(G(X)|_{\partial\beta X})\ar[r] & K_{1}(I_{G}) \ar[r] & \\
\ar[r] & K_{1}^{top}(G(X)|_{\partial\beta X}) \ar[r] \ar[u]^{\mu^{bdry}}& K^{top}(X \times X) \ar[r]_{1}\ar[u]_{2}& K_{0}^{top}(G(X)) \ar[r]\ar[u]^{\mu}& K_{0}^{top}(G(X)|_{\partial\beta X}) \ar[r]\ar[u]^{\mu^{bdry}}& 0\ar[u]^{0} \ar[r] &
}
$$
Corollary \ref{Thm:MT1} allows us to conclude that $\mu^{bdry}$ is an isomorphism. Now we treat cases. If $X$ has an infinite coarse component then Lemma \ref{lem:zandi}.(1) implies the map $K^{top}(X\times X) \rightarrow K^{top}(G(X))$ is the zero map. Now assume that $x \in K^{top}(G(X))$ maps to $0$ in $K_{0}(C^{*}_{r}(G(X))$. Then it maps to $0$ in $K^{top}(G(X)|_{\partial\beta X})$ as $\mu^{bdry}$ is an isomorphism. As the second line is exact, this implies it comes an element in $K^{top}(X\times X)$. As the map labelled $1$ is the zero map, $x$ must be $0$.

If $X$ has only finite coarse components, then by Lemma \ref{lem:zandi} the map $2$ is injective and so we can conclude injectivity of $\mu$ by the Five Lemma.
\end{proof}

We can also describe the obstructions to $\mu_{*}$ being an isomorphism when $X$ admits a fibred coarse embedding into Hilbert space.

\begin{proposition}\label{thm:MT2}
Let $X$ be a uniformly discrete metric space with bounded geometry such that $X$ admits a fibred coarse embedding into Hilbert space. Then the inclusion of $\mathcal{K}$ into $I_{G}$ induces an isomorphism on K-theory if and only if $\mu_{*}$ is an isomorphism. In addition, if $X$ has only finite coarse components then every ghost projection in $C^{*}X$ is compact if and only if $\mu_{0}$ is an isomorphism.
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}
We consider the diagram from the proof of Theorem \ref{thm:mcor1}
$$
\xymatrix@=1em{
\ar[r] & K_{1}(C^{*}_{r}(G(X)|_{\partial\beta X}) \ar[r] & K_{0}(I_{G}) \ar[r]& K_{0}(C^{*}_{r}(G(X))) \ar[r]& K_{0}(C^{*}_{r}(G(X)|_{\partial\beta X})\ar[r] & K_{1}(I_{G}) \ar[r] & \\
\ar[r] & K_{1}^{top}(G(X)|_{\partial\beta X}) \ar[r] \ar[u]^{\mu^{bdry}}& K^{top}(X \times X) \ar[r]_{1}\ar[u]_{2}& K_{0}^{top}(G(X)) \ar[r]\ar[u]^{\mu}& K_{0}^{top}(G(X)|_{\partial\beta X}) \ar[r]\ar[u]^{\mu^{bdry}}& 0\ar[u]^{0} \ar[r] &
}
$$
When $X$ fibred coarsely embeds into Hilbert space, we know that $\mu^{bdry}$ is an isomorphism. The result then follows from the Five Lemma.

Now assume $X$ has only finite coarse components: it is enough to consider just sequences of finite graphs $\lbrace X_{i}\rbrace$ and in this case we have access to a tracelike map defined in \cite{higsonpreprint, explg1} given as follows.

For any $T \in C^{*}X$ we have a natural decomposition $T= T_{0} \sqcup \bigsqcup_{i>i_{R}}T_{i}$, where each $T_{i} \in C^{*}X_{i}$. We define a map $\frac{\prod_{i}C^{*}X_{i}}{\oplus C^{*}X_{i}}$ that sends each $T$ to $\prod_{i>i_{R}} T_{i}$. This induces a map on K-theory that we denote by $Tr$.
\begin{eqnarray*}
Tr:K_{0}(C^{*}X) \rightarrow \frac{\prod_{i}K_{0}(C^{*}X_{i})}{\oplus_{i}K_{0}(C^{*}X_{i})}.
\end{eqnarray*}
Under this trace a non-compact ghost projection will be non-zero but a compact will be $0$. If $\mu$ is an isomorphism, it follows that every ghost projection is equivalent to a compact on K-theory, that is $K_{*}(\mathcal{K}) \cong K_{*}(I_{G})$. Hence, any ghost projection in $C^{*}(X)$ vanishes under $Tr$, which happens if and only if the ghost projection is compact \cite{explg1}.
\end{proof}

A natural corollary of this concerns coarse embeddings, which partially answers a question initially raised by Roe \cite[Chapter 11]{MR2007488}:

\begin{corollary}\label{thm:IT3}
If $X$ coarsely embeds into Hilbert space then $K_{*}(I_{G}) \cong K_{*}(\mathcal{K})$. \qed
\end{corollary}

Additionally Proposition \ref{thm:MT2} implies that for the spaces of graphs that coarsely embed into Hilbert space but do not have property A \cite{MR2899681,MR2920843} it is not possible to find a ghost projection that is non-compact inside the Roe algebra. 

\subsection{Box spaces of residually finite discrete groups}
Let $\Gamma$ be a finitely generated residually finite discrete group, and let $\mathcal{N}:=\lbrace N_{i} \rbrace_{i\in\mathbb{N}}$ be a family of nested finite index subgroups with trivial intersection. Fix a generating set $S$ for $\Gamma$. Then we can construct a metric space $\square \Gamma$, called the \textit{box space} of $\Gamma$ with respect to the family $\mathcal{N}$ by considering the space of graphs of the sequence: $\lbrace Cay(\frac{\Gamma}{N_{i}},S) \rbrace_{i}$. 

It is well known \cite[Proposition 11.26]{MR2007488} that a coarse embedding of $\square \Gamma$ into Hilbert space implies that $\Gamma$ is a-T-menable. Using Theorem 2.2 from \cite{FCEpaper}, it is possible to show that if $\Gamma$ is a-T-menable, then any box space of $\Gamma$ has a fibred coarse embedding. The following Lemma will allow us to prove the converse of Theorem 2.2 from \cite{FCEpaper} using Corollary \ref{Thm:MT1}.

\begin{lemma}\label{lem:cor2}
Let $\square \Gamma$ be a box space of a finitely generated residually finite group $\Gamma$. Then the boundary $\partial\beta X$ admits a $\Gamma$-invariant Borel probability measure.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
We work via linear functionals on $C(\beta X)$; consider the function:
\begin{equation*}
\mu(f)=\lim \frac{1}{\vert X_{i} \vert}\sum_{x \in X_{i}}f(x_{i}).
\end{equation*}
Clearly, $\mu(1_{\beta X})=1$ and $\mu$ is linear, whence $\mu$ is a linear functional. Let $g \in \Gamma$, now we check invariance:
\begin{equation*}
\mu(g\circ f)=\lim \frac{1}{\vert X_{i} \vert}\sum_{x \in X_{i}}f(gx_{i}).
\end{equation*}
After relabelling the elements $x \in X_{i}$ by $g^{-1}x^{'}$, we now see that $\mu(f)=\mu(g \circ f)$. The result now follows.
\end{proof}

It is well known that the boundary groupoid associated to a box space $\square\Gamma$ decomposes as $\partial\beta \square \Gamma \rtimes \Gamma$, for a proof see \cite{mypub1}. We now recall Corollary 5.12 of \cite{BG-action-2012}:

\begin{proposition}\label{prop:cor}
Let $\Gamma$ be a discrete group acting on a space $X$ with an invariant probablity measure $\mu$. Then the action is a-T-menable if and only if $\Gamma$ is a-T-menable.\qed
\end{proposition}

Now Lemma \ref{lem:cor2} plus the above Proposition prove:

\begin{theorem}\label{thm:cor2}
Let $\Gamma$ be a residually finite discrete group. If the box space $\square \Gamma$ admits a fibred coarse embedding then the group $\Gamma$ is a-T-menable.\qed
\end{theorem}
